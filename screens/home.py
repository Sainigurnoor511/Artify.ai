    # How FLUX Works
    st.header("How FLUX Works")
    st.write(
        "FLUX operates by utilizing complex neural network architectures that have been trained on vast datasets of images and their corresponding textual descriptions. "
        "When a user inputs a prompt, the model analyzes the text to identify key concepts and relationships, then synthesizes this information to generate a coherent and relevant image. "
        "The process involves several steps, including text encoding, image generation, and fine-tuning to enhance visual quality and fidelity to the prompt."

    # Explanation of Stable Diffusion
    st.header("Relation to Stable Diffusion")
    st.write(
        "Stable Diffusion is a specific type of generative model used for image synthesis that shares similarities with the FLUX models. "
        "Both frameworks employ diffusion processes to iteratively refine an image from random noise based on a given text prompt. "
        "In essence, Stable Diffusion adds a layer of stability and coherence to the image generation process, ensuring that the final output aligns closely with the user's intent while minimizing artifacts and inconsistencies."
